## Overview

The **AI Resume Analyser with NLP on Streamlit** is a web-based application that helps recruiters and hiring managers quickly analyze resumes by extracting key information such as name, contact details, skills, education, work experience, and certifications. The app leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automate the extraction and presentation of essential data from resumes, saving time and effort in the recruitment process.

This project is designed to help streamline the hiring process by quickly processing resumes and organizing the extracted data into a user-friendly format for easier review.

## How It Works

The application works in the following steps:

1. **Resume Upload**: The user uploads a resume in PDF format through the web interface.
   
2. **Resume Parsing**: Once the resume is uploaded, the system parses the resume using NLP techniques to extract important information. This includes personal details (like name, email, phone), skills, work experience, education, certifications, and more.

3. **Data Presentation**: The extracted data is displayed in a clean, well-organized format. Each section of the resume (e.g., personal information, skills, experience) is presented separately, making it easy for the recruiter to view and assess.

4. **Data Visualization**: The app also includes visualizations, such as charts, to help recruiters quickly assess the candidate's skills, experience, and qualifications.

5. **Database Storage**: The parsed data from each resume is saved in a database for future use. This enables recruiters to track and manage candidate information over time.

6. **Admin Interface**: An admin interface allows recruiters to view and manage the collected data, including visualizations of skills and experience for easy comparison between candidates.

## Benefits of the Project

- **Automates Resume Screening**: The application automates the tedious task of manually reviewing resumes, saving recruiters a significant amount of time and effort.
  
- **Accurate Data Extraction**: Using NLP, the app ensures accurate extraction of relevant information from resumes, reducing human error and improving efficiency.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The clean, organized presentation of extracted data ensures that recruiters can easily read and assess resumes without being overwhelmed by unnecessary details.

- **Data-Driven Insights**: The visualizations allow recruiters to gain quick insights into candidates' skills, experience, and qualifications, making it easier to compare candidates at a glance.

- **Streamlined Recruitment Process**: By automating the initial stages of recruitment, the application helps organizations speed up the hiring process, making it more efficient and less resource-intensive.

- **Easy Integration**: The system is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing recruitment workflows, enabling organizations to quickly adopt it without major changes to their process.

- **Centralized Database**: Storing resume data in a central database makes it easier for recruiters to track candidates, access historical data, and manage candidate information over time.

## Future Enhancements

- **Automatic Job Matching**: Integrating a feature that matches resumes with job descriptions, suggesting the best-fit candidates for each position.
  
- **Resume Scoring**: Adding functionality to rank resumes based on their relevance to job requirements, helping prioritize candidates.

- **PDF Download**: Allowing users to download the extracted resume data in a downloadable PDF format.

- **Integration with Job Portals**: Expanding the project to directly integrate with job portals, so that resumes uploaded on these platforms can also be processed automatically.
